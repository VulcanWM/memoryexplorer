# Leaderboard Benchmark

A C program that implements and benchmarks three data structures for storing user scores:  

- **Dynamic Array**  
- **Linked List**  
- **Hash Table**  

It can **load**, **search**, **add**, **amend**, and **remove** entries from a dataset of usernames and scores.

## How to Run

All you need to do is download the executable file from the [latest release](https://github.com/VulcanWM/memoryexplorer/releases/tag/v1.0.0), and run `./leaderboard_app` in your terminal!
